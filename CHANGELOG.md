# Changelog

Notable changes in each release. Versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/);
see [docs/VERSIONING.md](docs/VERSIONING.md). Each release's notes are its
section below.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-10-19

### Breaking

- On Kubernetes, every `TEST_DIRS` key and `--read-from` path names its claim:
  `[namespace/]claim:path`. `KUBECTL_PVC` and `KUBECTL_PV` are removed.
- `--env-override` may no longer set `TEST_DIRS` or `FS_MAX_*`; put them in a
  `--target` file.
- One filesystem report no longer combines results from different storage
  targets, such as sweep directories with different `TEST_DIRS` passed
  together; `--allow-mixed-targets` combines them anyway. Batch reports are
  unaffected: each group is reported separately.

See [Upgrading from v1.8.0](docs/FILESYSTEM_TESTING.md#upgrading-from-v180).

### Added

- Spread load across several filesystems with weighted `TEST_DIRS` roots, now
  also across Kubernetes claims
  ([#16](https://github.com/NVIDIA/storage-scale-test/issues/16)). See
  [Testing several filesystems](docs/FILESYSTEM_TESTING.md#testing-several-filesystems).
- Compare filesystems in one batch with one `--target` file each, then report
  the batch directory as usual: each target gets its own report. A Kubernetes
  batch can span namespaces. See
  [Storage target reference](docs/FILESYSTEM_TESTING.md#storage-target-reference)
  and [Several Kubernetes namespaces](docs/FILESYSTEM_TESTING.md#several-kubernetes-namespaces).
- `STORAGE_TARGET_NAME` names a storage target (derived from `TEST_DIRS` when
  unset); results and reports record it. See
  [Reporting per target](docs/FILESYSTEM_TESTING.md#reporting-per-target).
- Repeat `--env-override` to stack workload files. See
  [Workload override files](docs/FILESYSTEM_TESTING.md#workload-override-files).

### Changed

- `validate_env.sh` is faster, especially on busy Slurm clusters, and prints a
  short summary unless `--verbose`. Errors name the node and the likely cause
  (such as a filesystem that cannot mount or is not writable).
- `KUBECTL_ELBENCHO_IMAGE` defaults to the pinned elbencho image when unset.
- CSV exports gain a `storage_target_name` column; older CSVs still load.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-10-09

### Added

- Kubernetes (`EXECUTION_SUBSTRATE=kubectl`) runs filesystem IO and
  metadata sweeps alongside SSH and Slurm. Sweeps run in the cluster; use
  `--status`, `--collect`, `--cancel`, and `--resume` to follow them. See
  [Kubernetes](README.md#kubernetes).
- Prepared filesystem batches: build a set of IO and metadata sweeps with
  `--batch` and `--append`, run them together with `--start`, and report
  them with `utils/extract-filesystem.py`, which also saves one combined
  `reports.txt`. See
  [Prepared filesystem batches](docs/FILESYSTEM_TESTING.md#prepared-filesystem-batches).
- Workload override files: `--env-override FILE` changes selected workload
  settings for one run or batch group without editing `env.sh`. See
  [Workload override files](docs/FILESYSTEM_TESTING.md#workload-override-files).
- Metadata sweeps can be resumed with `--resume`, like IO sweeps. See
  [Metadata sweeps](docs/FILESYSTEM_TESTING.md#metadata-sweeps).
- Completion-based IO sweeps: buffered IO, multiple `TEST_DIRS` roots, or
  `--run-to-completion` process a finite dataset once instead of running
  for a fixed time. See [First IO sweep](docs/FILESYSTEM_TESTING.md#first-io-sweep).
- Project versions: commands accept `--version`, results record the
  version that produced them, and reports list it. See
  [docs/VERSIONING.md](docs/VERSIONING.md).
- Deployment tarballs and release source archives carry their version
  and detect later edits.

### Changed

- Result tools are executable Python (`utils/extract-*.py`,
  `utils/summarize-elbencho.py`) that set up `.venv` on first use; the
  `.sh` wrappers are gone, so update scripts that call them.
- elbencho v3.2-1 is the pinned download and default Kubernetes image.
- Deployment tarballs leave out object storage credentials. See
  [Prepare the tools](docs/OBJECT_STORAGE_TESTING.md#prepare-the-tools).

# Versions

Releases are annotated Git tags named `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, such as `v1.2.3`.
Changes between releases are in [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md).

## Reading a version

| Version | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `v1.2.3` | Exactly the `v1.2.3` release. |
| `v1.2.3-4-g0123456789ab` | Four commits after `v1.2.3`, at commit `0123456789ab`. |
| `untagged-42-g0123456789ab` | Commit `0123456789ab`; no release tag is in its history. |
| `shallow-g0123456789ab` | A shallow clone whose commit has no release tag. |
| `unknown` | Neither Git metadata nor a `VERSION` file was found. |

A `-modified` suffix means the source differs from that commit or release.
Ignored files such as `env.sh`, `results/`, and downloaded binaries don't
count. Requires Git 2.15 or newer.

Deployment tarballs and release source archives have no Git metadata; they
carry a `VERSION` file and a `SOURCE_SHA256` file list, which
`sha256sum -c SOURCE_SHA256` checks. `env.sh`, credentials, and benchmark
binaries are not listed, so adding or replacing them doesn't count.

User-facing commands accept `--version`; launcher and reporter `--version` and
`--help` work before `env.sh` or reporting dependencies are set up. A built
`s3test` binary also reports its version.

## Results and reports

Each result file gets a `<name>.out.project-version` file recording the version
that ran it, and each run log starts with the version. A resumed run keeps the
versions of results that already succeeded.

Reports list the versions that produced their results and the reporter's own:

```text
Produced by storage-scale-test: v1.2.3, v1.3.0
Reported by storage-scale-test: v1.4.0
```

`unknown` covers results recorded before versioning and metrics loaded from
reporter CSV files or Warp analyzed JSON.

## Releasing

1. Move the `Unreleased` notes in `CHANGELOG.md` under a new
   `## [1.2.3] - YYYY-MM-DD` heading and merge that to `main`.
2. Tag the merged commit and push the tag:

   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.2.3 -m v1.2.3
   git push origin v1.2.3
   ```

The release workflow runs the source checks, builds and verifies
`storage-scale-test-v1.2.3-source.tar.gz` and its `.sha256`, and publishes a
GitHub release with the changelog section as its notes. It refuses tags that
are not on `main` or have no changelog section, and can be rerun safely.

To build and check an archive locally:

```bash
python3 utils/build_source_release.py --tag v1.2.3 --smoke
```

GitHub's automatic "Source code" downloads report `unknown`; use the attached
archive. Anyone who can push a `v*` tag can start a release, so restrict tag
creation with a repository ruleset.

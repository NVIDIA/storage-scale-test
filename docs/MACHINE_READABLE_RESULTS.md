# Machine-readable results

Every filesystem report writes one versioned JSON document, `results.json`:
what was meant to run, what ran, and what it measured. It covers IO and
metadata (mdtest) executions. Warp and netbench have no such document.

## Producing it

```bash
./utils/extract-filesystem.py "$BATCH"                         # $BATCH/reports/results.json
./utils/extract-filesystem.py "$BATCH" --output-dir out        # out/results.json
./utils/extract-filesystem.py "$BATCH" --require-complete
./utils/extract-elbencho.py "$DIR"                             # $DIR/results.json
./utils/extract-elbencho.py "$DIR1" "$DIR2" --output-dir out   # out/results.json
```

The document is always `<output-dir>/results.json`, beside the text reports,
plots, and [`report.html`](HTML_REPORT.md), which are all rendered from it.
`--from-json PATH...` renders them again from documents (any schema 1.x) into
a separate `--output-dir`, without rewriting them. `<output-dir>` defaults to
`<batch>/reports` for a batch and to the input directory otherwise. The
document and `report.html` are written to a temporary name and renamed.

An ordinary (non-batch) directory uses the same schema. `batch.root` is that
directory, the manifest fields are `null`, and it has one group, `"0000"`.
Several input directories need a separate `--output-dir` and give one group
per input, `"0001"`, `"0002"`, ... in input order; `batch.root` is their
common parent.

| Option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--live-detail LEVEL` | `none`, `summary`, `selected`, or `full` (default). IO only. See [Live detail](#live-detail). |
| `--require-complete` | Exit 3 after writing if `batch_outcome.complete` is false. |

Report filters (`--only-*`, `--groups`, `--kind`) apply and are recorded in
`generator.options`.

Gate on the document, not the exit status. Without `--require-complete`, an
incomplete batch exits 0; all statuses are in
[filesystem reporting](FILESYSTEM_TESTING.md#exit-statuses).

The document is plain JSON. Live sidecars are always `.jsonl.zst`. Each
recorded `sha256` and `size_bytes` describes the stored bytes.

## Conventions

- **Units are in names:** `_bytes`, `_bytes_per_s`, `_ops_per_s`, `_us`
  (latency), `_ms` (measured times), `_s` (configured durations).
- **Rounding:** throughput to whole bytes/s (from elbencho MiB/s x 1048576);
  operation rates to 0.01; latencies to 0.1 us.
- **`null`** means not measured or not applicable; the enclosing `problems`
  list says why. Zero is a measured zero.
- **Enums** are lowercase `snake_case`. Tolerate unknown values and fields.
- **Paths** are relative to `batch.root`, which is absolute and
  symlink-resolved, except sidecar paths (`client_series.path`), which are
  relative to the document's directory. Paths to data outside the batch (for
  example `read_from`) are recorded as the run recorded them.
- **Histograms** are columnar: `{"buckets_us": [...], "counts": [...]}`,
  ascending.
- **Determinism:** keys in schema order; groups, executions, and phases in a
  fixed order. Two exports of the same inputs differ only in
  `generator.generated_at`.
- **Failed executions are not parsed.** Only ledger state `success`
  contributes results.

## Top level

| Field | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `schema`, `schema_version` | `storage-scale-test/filesystem-batch-results`, `"MAJOR.MINOR"` (currently `"1.1"`). |
| `generator` | `tool`, `version`, `generated_at` (UTC), `command`, `options` (`live_detail`, `shortfall_percent`, `min_slow_windows`, `client_max_timeseries_lines`, `client_max_heatmap_rows`, `no_dual_y_axis`, `normalize_to`, `only_nodes`, `only_threads`, `only_sizes`, `only_iodepths`, `groups`, `kind`; `null` when unused). |
| `batch` | `root`, `datestamp`, `manifest_version`, `manifest_sha256`, `sealed`, `substrate`. |
| `batch_outcome` | `complete`; `executions` counts (`total` plus one per `ledger_state`); `results` counts (one per `result_state`); `groups_reported`; `groups_not_reported`. |
| `groups` | One object per batch group. |
| `executions` | One object per committed execution, sorted by group, then ID. |
| `diagnostics` | Document-level `problems` entries, such as `execution_unmatched` and `no_execution_ledger`. |

`batch_outcome.complete` is true only when there is at least one execution and
every execution has ledger state `success` and result state `complete`. Check
it first. Filters never drop executions: a filtered execution is listed as
`not_reported`, so a filtered export is never complete.

## Groups

| Field | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `group_id`, `kind` | `kind` is `io` or `mdtest`. |
| `label` | Always `null` for now. |
| `output_relative` | The group's output directory. |
| `source` | Absolute path of the group's result directory. |
| `target` | `{"name", "recorded"}`: the storage target name and whether the run recorded it. |
| `settings_sha256` | `env_used_sh`, `env_used_yaml`. |
| `env_override` | Override files and the variables they set, or `null`. |
| `settings` | The group's `env_used.yaml`, as parsed. |
| `settings_text` | The same file, verbatim; `null` if unreadable. |
| `execution_ids` | The group's executions, in order. |
| `unpaired_live` | [Live objects](#live-object) for every domain of the group's live CSVs that have no result pair. |

## Executions

Every execution carries `coordinates` and `coordinate_key`, whether or not it
has results. `dataset` and `results` are present only when parsed, and `null`
otherwise.

| Field | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `execution_id`, `group_id`, `kind`, `definition_sha256` | Identity. IDs are unique only within a batch. |
| `ledger_state` | `success`, `failed`, `pending`, `running`, `cancelled`, `interrupted`, or `unknown`. `unknown` appears only for ordinary directories without a ledger. |
| `result_state` | See below. |
| `problems` | `{"code", "detail", "phase"}` objects; `phase` may be `null`. `detail` is free text. |
| `coordinates` | Test parameters; see below. |
| `coordinate_key` | Identifies the test point across batches. Excludes the target, a group property. |
| `dataset` | IO only. |
| `producer_version` | IO only: the version recorded beside the `.out` file (`<name>.out.project-version`, listed in `result_files`), or `null`. Metadata records it per iteration. |
| `result_files` | `{"path", "sha256", "size_bytes"}` for each raw result file. |
| `log` | Relative path of the execution log, or `null`. |
| `results` | IO or metadata results. |

| `result_state` | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `complete` | Every expected phase or iteration parsed and validated. |
| `partial` | Some were dropped or incomplete; `problems` says which. |
| `missing` | No result files. |
| `unparseable` | Result files exist, but none parse. |
| `not_reported` | Excluded by a report filter. |
| `not_run` | Ledger state is not `success`. |

| Problem code | Where | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `phase_missing` | IO | A phase expected by `phase_plan` has no result. |
| `phase_unparseable` | IO | Result files exist but no phase parsed. |
| `percentiles_missing` | IO | Latency percentiles absent from the `.out` file. |
| `rates_missing` | IO | An `elbencho_first` rate is absent or malformed in the CSV; it is `null`. |
| `completion_incomplete` | IO | A phase did not complete all its work. |
| `live_csv_unreadable` | IO | The live CSV could not be analyzed. Does not change `result_state`. |
| `iteration_incomplete` | metadata | An iteration has partial or invalid data; listed on the iteration and, prefixed with its number, on the execution. |
| `iterations_missing` | metadata | Expected iterations have no result files. |
| `report_failed` | any | The group's report failed (`missing`). |
| `definition_unreadable` | any | The execution definition could not be parsed; `coordinates` is `null`. |
| `execution_unmatched` | `diagnostics` | Result files match no ledger execution. |
| `no_execution_ledger` | `diagnostics` | An ordinary directory has no `executions/NNNN.sh`; ledger state is `unknown`. |

`phase_missing`, `percentiles_missing`, `rates_missing`, and
`completion_incomplete` make an IO execution `partial`.

### IO coordinates

Parsed from the execution definition.

| Field | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `nodes`, `threads_per_node`, `io_depth` | Counts. |
| `io_size_spec` | The sweep's size string, for provenance. |
| `phase_plan` | `write_read`, `write_only`, `write_no_read`, or `read_from`. |
| `write_block_size_bytes`, `write_access`, `read_block_size_bytes`, `read_access` | Parsed from `io_size_spec`. Access is `sequential` or `random`. `null` when the plan has no such phase. |
| `direct_io` | `true` for direct IO, `false` for buffered. |
| `run_to_completion`, `single_big_file`, `all_nodes_all_data` | Booleans. |
| `file_layout` | For example `worker-directories`. |

`coordinate_key` looks like `io/c004/s032/d016/w1M-seq/r4K-rand/dio`: nodes,
threads, depth, write and read size and access (`none` for an absent phase),
and `dio` or `bio`.

### IO dataset

`source` (`generated` or `read_from`), `read_from`,
`kubernetes_mapped_read_from`, `write_only_data_dir`, `layout`, `files_total`,
`bytes_total`, `treefile_source`, `scanned_file_sizes`
(`count`, `avg_bytes`, `min_bytes`, `max_bytes`; `null` when no scan ran), and
`first_file_bytes` (size of the first file, when only that was logged).

From `workload.tsv`, all `null` without it: `count_source`
(`configuration` or `treefile`), `files_per_node` (`requested`, `effective`),
and `reader` (`nodes`, `threads_per_node`, `io_depth`). `files_total` and
`bytes_total` are `null` while pending.

### IO results

`results.phases` has one object per phase that ran, in run order (`write`,
`read`, `delete`). `results.additional_live_domains` has a
[live object](#live-object) for each live CSV domain not in `phases[].live`,
ordered by phase, `mix_type` and `occurrence` (`[]` without one).
`results.datestamp` is the result files' datestamp.
`results.workload` (`null` for layouts without `workload.tsv`) holds
`termination_mode`, `completion_state`, `failure_cleanup_state`, and the
elapsed times `write_elapsed_ms`, `read_elapsed_ms`, `write_delete_elapsed_ms`
and `lifecycle_elapsed_ms`.

| Phase field | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `phase`, `completion_state` | `completion_state` is a workload enum, or `null`. |
| `elbencho_first` | `ops_per_s`, `bytes_per_s`, `elapsed_ms`: elbencho's `[first]` column, the aggregate from phase start until the fastest worker thread finished. |
| `elbencho_last` | The same fields from the `[last]` column: until the slowest worker thread finished. |
| `latency_us` | `min`, `avg`, `max`, `p1`, `p50`, `p75`, `p99`. A missing percentile is `null`. |
| `histogram_us`, `work`, `file_size_bytes`, `configured_time_limit_s`, `command`, `live` | Latency histogram; expected and completed files and bytes; the CSV file size (`null` if none); the configured limit; the recorded argv; the [live object](#live-object). |

The `delete` phase has only `phase`, `completion_state`, `work`, and
`elapsed_ms`.

Reports and tables use `elbencho_first`. Use `elbencho_last` for the rate the
whole fleet sustained.

### Metadata coordinates and results

Coordinates are `nodes`, `tasks_per_node`, `branch_factor`, `items_per_dir`,
and `iterations`. The key looks like `md/c002/t064/b4/i1000`.

`results.iterations` lists every iteration: `iteration`, `datestamp`,
`producer_version`, `state` (`complete` or `incomplete`), `problems`, and
`phases` (`create`, `stat`, `delete`, each with `ops_per_s`, `elapsed_ms`,
`latency_us` of `min`/`avg`/`max`, `histogram_us`, and `command`, the recorded
argv). `results.aggregate` uses only complete
iterations: `iterations_expected`, `iterations_used`, and per phase `ops_per_s`
(`mean`, `stddev`, `min`, `max`), `mean_elapsed_ms`, `latency_us`
(`p0`, `p50`, `p90`, `p99`, `p100`), and `latency_method`
(`pooled_histogram_bucket`).

## Live detail

Live data comes from elbencho live CSVs, which IO sweeps capture unless
`ELBENCHO_LIVE_CSV_EXTENDED=0`. A domain is one phase, mix type and
occurrence of a live CSV. `phases[].live` holds the first domain of its
phase; `additional_live_domains` holds the rest (`sync`, mixed and repeated
phases), so together they list every domain, each once.

| `--live-detail` | Per domain |
| --- | --- |
| `none` | `live` is `{"reason": "not_requested"}`. |
| `summary` | Aggregate and fleet series, distribution statistics, every client's summary, diagnostics. |
| `selected` | `summary`, plus inline one-interval rates for the clients the report selects: persistent and transient slow clients, then representatives (bounded by `--client-max-timeseries-lines` and `--client-max-heatmap-rows`). |
| `full` | `summary`, plus every client's rates in a sidecar. |

Below `full`, `report.html` omits per-client charts.

Without an analysis, `live` is `{"reason": R}` with `R` one of `not_captured`,
`not_requested`, or `unreadable`.

### Live object

| Field | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `source` | `path`, `sha256`, `size_bytes` of the live CSV. |
| `configured_interval_ms` | `ELBENCHO_LIVEINT`, or `null`. |
| `client_mode` | `worker` or `service`; see below. |
| `domain` | `phase`, `mix_type`, `occurrence`. In `phases[].live`, further domains of the phase are counted in `diagnostics.additional_domains`. |
| `phase_context` | From the phase's result pair, else `null`: `first_ms`, `last_ms` (elbencho `[first]`/`[last]` times), `block_size_bytes`, `final_avg_latency_us`. |
| `intervals`, `clients` | Counts. |
| `steady` | `start_ms`, `end_ms`, `end_source` (`elbencho_first`), `reason` (`null`, `no_first_time`, `too_short`, or `no_steady_state`), and `interval_ms`, the live interval used. See [live reports](FILESYSTEM_TESTING.md#live-client-and-latency-reports). |
| `aggregate_series` | Columnar: `elapsed_ms`, `bytes_per_s`, `ops_per_s`, `io_latency_avg_us` (fleet mean IO latency), `entries_latency_avg_us`, `clock_skew_ms`; `null` is a missing or invalid sample. `start_time` is the first sample's `ISO Date`, verbatim. |
| `fleet_series` | Columnar per-interval client statistics: `elapsed_ms`, `client_count`, `bytes_per_s_p10`, `_p50`, `_p90`, `_mean`, `_stddev`. |
| `fairness` | `null` without a steady window; else `interval`, `5s`, and `30s`, each `null` or `{window_ms, windows, jain {min, p10, p50}, jain_min_at_ms, share_below_0_95, min_over_median_p10, floor_p50, series {end_ms, clients, jain}}` over the windows inside the steady window. `min_over_median_p10` is the p10 of each window's slowest-client ratio; `floor_p50` is the expected Jain floor. |
| `latency` | `null` without steady latency; else `p50_us`, `p90_us`, `max_us`, `max_over_p50`, `cv`, `steady_mean_us` (op-weighted), `final_avg_us` (from `.out`), and Spearman `rho_jain_latency` and `rho_latency_throughput` over 5 s windows (`null` under 6). |
| `distribution` | Imbalance without per-client data: `client_mean_bytes_per_s` (`min`, `p10`, `p50`, `p90`, `max`, `cv`), `min_over_median`, `max_over_median`, `final_done_bytes` (`min`, `p50`, `max`, `cv`), `finish_elapsed_ms` (`min`, `p50`, `max`), `persistent_clients`, `transient_clients` (`null` when the steady window is unavailable). |
| `clients_summary` | `{"columns": [...], "rows": [[...]]}`, one row per client: `client`, `rank`, `service`, `kubernetes_node`, `kubernetes_pod`, `class`, `mean_bytes_per_s`, `median_bytes_per_s`, `mean_ratio_to_fleet_median`, `steady_bytes_per_s`, `steady_ratio`, `worst_5s_ratio`, `worst_5s_elapsed_ms`, `worst_30s_ratio`, `worst_30s_elapsed_ms`, `short_5s_share`, `final_done_bytes`, `finish_elapsed_ms`, `valid_samples`, `missing_samples`, `invalid_samples`, `short_5s_windows`, `steady_5s_windows`, `first_progress_elapsed_ms`. |
| `client_series` | `null` at `summary`; at `selected`, inline `clients`, `elapsed_ms`, and `bytes_per_s` (one list per client); at `full`, a sidecar reference `{"path", "sha256", "size_bytes", "clients", "intervals"}`. |
| `diagnostics` | `missing_samples`, `counter_resets`, `non_adjacent_samples`, and possibly `additional_domains`. |

### Slow-client classes

`class` is `persistent`, `transient`, or `ok`, by the rules in
[live reports](FILESYSTEM_TESTING.md#live-client-and-latency-reports); it and
the steady and worst-window columns are `null` without steady data.
`short_5s_share` is `short_5s_windows` (steady 5 s windows below 1 - S) over
`steady_5s_windows`. `first_progress_elapsed_ms` is the first interval with
`DoneBytes` above 0.

`final_done_bytes` is a client's last cumulative `DoneBytes` (its work share
in time-bounded runs). `finish_elapsed_ms` is the first interval at which it
reached that value (the straggler signal in completion-bound runs).

elbencho stamps samples from two clocks, so sample `i`'s `ISO Date` is
`start_time` plus `elapsed_ms[i] - elapsed_ms[0] + clock_skew_ms[i]` ms, in
`start_time`'s format (`live_timestamp` in `lib/elbencho_live_results.py`).

### Client mode

A client row is a local worker thread (`worker`) or a remote elbencho service
(`service`). Executions on one node run threads; executions on more than one
node run services, on every substrate (SSH hosts, Slurm nodes, Kubernetes
worker Pods). On Kubernetes, `kubernetes_node` and `kubernetes_pod` come from
the collected `executions/<id>.workers.tsv`; elsewhere they are `null`.
"Clients" means threads in single-node runs.

### Sidecars

At `full`, each domain writes
`results.live/<execution_id>.<phase>[.<mix_type>][.occ<N>].jsonl.zst` beside
the document, referenced by `client_series.path`. An unpaired live CSV uses
its name and 12 hex digits of its SHA-256 instead of the execution ID.
Earlier sidecars in that directory are removed before each export. Each is
zstd-compressed JSON Lines in source order:

```json
{"schema": "storage-scale-test/live-client-series", "schema_version": "1.1", "execution_id": "0014", "phase": "write", "mix_type": "", "occurrence": 0, "clients": ["host001 [rank 0]", "..."]}
{"elapsed_ms": 1000, "bytes_per_s": [null, 1320000000, 1290000000], "done_bytes_delta": [1048576, 1320000000, 1290000000]}
```

`bytes_per_s[i]` and `done_bytes_delta[i]` belong to `clients[i]`;
`bytes_per_s` is `null` for a missing or invalid sample. `done_bytes_delta`
(1.1) is `DoneBytes` minus the client's previous sample (the first is
absolute; negative after a counter reset), `null` without a sample. Summing it
rebuilds the counters every live report and statistic is computed from.

### Size

Estimates, before compression. A raw `.live.csv` is about 200 bytes per row.

| Scenario | Raw live CSV | `summary` (in `results.json`) | `full` sidecars |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 256 clients, 2 x 300 s at 1 s | 31 MB | 270 KB | 1.7 MB |
| 1024 clients, 2 x 300 s at 1 s | 123 MB | 810 KB | 6.8 MB |
| 1024 clients, 2 x 3600 s at 1 s | 1.5 GB | 1.8 MB | 81 MB |

Figures are per execution. Over 200 executions of 1024 clients and an hour per
phase, `summary` totals about 360 MB and sidecars about 16 GB. Without live
data, an execution costs about 5-10 KB (IO) or 10-20 KB (metadata).

## Spot-checking with jq

These read the whole document but print only small tables; a 6 MB, 114-execution
batch answers each in about 0.1 s. Run them where the document is:

```bash
R=reports/results.json
cols() { column -t -s $'\t'; }
```

Overview: options, batch, and outcome counts.

```bash
jq '{schema_version, generated_at: .generator.generated_at, options: .generator.options,
     batch: (.batch | {datestamp, substrate, sealed}), outcome: .batch_outcome}' "$R"
```

Collection issues: every execution that is not `complete` or has problems,
then each problem's detail, then document-level diagnostics. No output means
none.

```bash
jq -r '.executions[] | select(.result_state != "complete" or (.problems | length) > 0)
  | [.group_id, .execution_id, .ledger_state, .result_state,
     (.problems | map(.code) | unique | join(",") | if . == "" then "-" else . end)]
  | @tsv' "$R" | cols
jq -r '.executions[] | .execution_id as $id | .problems[]
  | [$id, .code, (.phase // "-"), .detail] | @tsv' "$R"
jq -r '.diagnostics[] | [.code, .detail] | @tsv' "$R"
```

Groups, with target, size, result states, and whether an env override applied:

```bash
jq -r '.executions as $e | .groups[] | .group_id as $g
  | ($e | map(select(.group_id == $g))) as $mine
  | [$g, .kind, (.target.name // "-"), ($mine | length),
     ($mine | map(.result_state) | group_by(.) | map("\(.[0])=\(length)") | join(" ")),
     (if .env_override then "override" else "-" end)] | @tsv' "$R" | cols
```

Settings that differ between groups (what each group varied):

```bash
jq -r '[.groups[].settings | to_entries[]] | group_by(.key)
  | map(select((map(.value | tojson) | unique | length) > 1))[]
  | "\(.[0].key): \(map(.value | tojson) | unique | join(" | "))"' "$R"
```

All executions; add `select(.group_id == "0003")` after `.executions[] |`
for one group:

```bash
jq -r '.executions[] | [.group_id, .execution_id, .kind, .coordinate_key,
  .ledger_state, .result_state] | @tsv' "$R" | cols
```

One execution without the bulky histogram and live series:

```bash
jq --arg id 0001 '.executions[] | select(.execution_id == $id)
  | del(.results.phases[]?.histogram_us, .results.phases[]?.live.aggregate_series,
        .results.phases[]?.live.fleet_series, .results.phases[]?.live.clients_summary,
        .results.phases[]?.live.client_series)' "$R"
```

Logs of executions that need a look:

```bash
jq -r '.batch.root as $root | .executions[]
  | select(.ledger_state != "success" or .result_state != "complete")
  | "\(.execution_id) \(.ledger_state)/\(.result_state) \(if .log then "\($root)/\(.log)" else "(no log)" end)"' "$R"
```

IO results, one row per phase (GB/s is 10^9 bytes/s):

```bash
jq -r '(["id","coordinate_key","phase","first_GB/s","last_GB/s","first_IOPS","p99_us"]),
  (.executions[] | select(.kind == "io" and .results != null) | . as $e
   | .results.phases[] | select(.phase != "delete")
   | [$e.execution_id, $e.coordinate_key, .phase,
      (.elbencho_first.bytes_per_s | if . then . / 1e9 * 100 | round / 100 else null end),
      (.elbencho_last.bytes_per_s | if . then . / 1e9 * 100 | round / 100 else null end),
      .elbencho_first.ops_per_s, .latency_us.p99]) | @tsv' "$R" | cols
```

The same test point across storage targets, `elbencho_first` GB/s:

```bash
jq -r '(.groups | map({(.group_id): (.target.name // "?")}) | add) as $target
  | [.executions[] | select(.kind == "io" and .results != null) | . as $e
     | .results.phases[] | select(.phase != "delete")
     | {key: $e.coordinate_key, phase, target: $target[$e.group_id],
        gbps: (.elbencho_first.bytes_per_s | if . then . / 1e9 * 100 | round / 100 else null end)}]
  | (map(.target) | unique) as $targets
  | (["coordinate_key", "phase"] + $targets),
    (group_by([.key, .phase])[] | . as $rows
     | [.[0].key, .[0].phase] + [$targets[] as $t | $rows | map(select(.target == $t)) | first | .gbps])
  | @tsv' "$R" | cols
```

Metadata aggregates over the complete iterations:

```bash
jq -r '(["id","coordinate_key","iters","phase","mean_ops/s","stddev","p99_us"]),
  (.executions[] | select(.kind == "mdtest" and .results != null) | . as $e
   | .results.aggregate as $a | $a.phases[]
   | [$e.execution_id, $e.coordinate_key, "\($a.iterations_used)/\($a.iterations_expected)",
      .phase, .ops_per_s.mean, .ops_per_s.stddev, .latency_us.p99]) | @tsv' "$R" | cols
```

Live coverage, then client balance per analyzed phase:

```bash

The five slowest clients of one phase:

```bash
jq -r --arg id 0001 --arg phase write '.executions[] | select(.execution_id == $id)
  | .results.phases[] | select(.phase == $phase) | .live.clients_summary
  | .columns as $c | .rows | map([$c, .] | transpose | map({(.[0]): .[1]}) | add)
  | map(select(.steady_ratio != null)) | sort_by(.steady_ratio) | .[:5][]
  | [.client, (.kubernetes_node // "-"), (.class // "-"), .steady_ratio,
     .worst_5s_ratio, .finish_elapsed_ms] | @tsv' "$R" | cols
```

A `full` sidecar: its header, then the slowest client per interval.

```bash
zstd -dc "$(dirname "$R")/results.live/0001.write.jsonl.zst" | jq -c 'if .schema
  then {execution_id, phase, clients: (.clients | length)}
  else {elapsed_ms, slowest_bytes_per_s: (.bytes_per_s | map(select(. != null)) | min)} end'
```

Where the document's bytes go, largest executions first:

```bash
jq -r '.executions[] | [.execution_id, (tojson | length)] | @tsv' "$R" | sort -k2 -nr | head
```

## Schemas and versioning

- `docs/schemas/filesystem-batch-results-1.schema.json`: the document.
- `docs/schemas/live-client-series-1.schema.json`: each sidecar line.

Both are JSON Schema 2020-12. `schema_version` is `MAJOR.MINOR`. A minor
version only adds optional fields or enum values; a major version renames,
removes, or changes the meaning or unit of a field, and its schema file name
changes. Check the major version; ignore unknown fields. Version 1.1 added
`settings_text`, `producer_version`, `file_size_bytes`, `first_file_bytes`, the
workload fields, `command` on metadata phases, the rendering options,
`additional_live_domains`, `unpaired_live`, and the live fields `phase_context`,
`steady.interval_ms`, `entries_latency_avg_us`, `start_time`,
`clock_skew_ms`, and three `clients_summary` columns; treat them as absent in
1.0 documents. Sidecar 1.1 added `mix_type`, `occurrence`, and
`done_bytes_delta`.

## Example

```python
import json
import sys

TARGET = {"io/c004/s032/d016/w1M-seq/r4K-rand/dio": 3.0e9}  # bytes/s

with open("results.json", encoding="utf-8") as stream:
    doc = json.load(stream)
if not doc["schema_version"].startswith("1."):
    sys.exit("unsupported schema")
if not doc["batch_outcome"]["complete"]:
    sys.exit("batch incomplete")

failed = []
for execution in doc["executions"]:
    target = TARGET.get(execution["coordinate_key"])
    phases = (execution["results"] or {}).get("phases", [])
    write = next((p for p in phases if p["phase"] == "write"), None)
    if target is not None and write:
        if write["elbencho_first"]["bytes_per_s"] < target:
            failed.append(execution["execution_id"])
sys.exit(f"below target: {failed}" if failed else 0)
```

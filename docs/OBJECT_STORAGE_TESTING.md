# Object storage testing

Configure and validate your [SSH or Slurm launcher](../README.md#getting-started)
first. Kubernetes and prepared filesystem batches do not support object tests.
Commands below run from the deployment directory.

## Prepare the tools

Supply Warp binaries for every client architecture as `utils/warp` and/or
`utils/warp.aarch64`. The tarball builder includes existing Warp binaries; it
does not download them. Build them before creating the deployment archive:

```bash
./utils/build/build_warp_from_source.sh
./utils/build_tarball.sh
```

The build helper defaults to [NVIDIA/warp-minio](https://github.com/NVIDIA/warp-minio)
and accepts another GitHub/GitLab URL with a tag, branch, or commit. Review its
help and third-party licenses before use. The tarball builder also builds
`s3test` for validation; check warnings for missing tools or architectures.

## Configure the target and run a sweep

Set `OBJ_BUCKET`, `OBJ_REGION`, `OBJ_HOST`, `OBJ_HOST_PORT`, and an absolute
`OBJ_AUTH_FILE` path in `env.sh`. The bucket must already exist and must contain
no valuable objects: the test cleans it and deletes its benchmark objects.
Store credentials in a mode-`0400` file:

```bash
export WARP_ACCESS_KEY="..."
export WARP_SECRET_KEY="..."
```

Configure object sizes, threads, PUT/GET durations, and the minimum object count
with `WARP_*` variables, run `validate_env.sh`, then establish a single-node
baseline before scaling:

```bash
./storage-tests/object/nv-warp-sweep.sh --nodes 1
# Set RUN to the complete result-directory path printed by the sweep.
./utils/extract-warp.sh "$RUN"
./storage-tests/object/nv-warp-sweep.sh --nodes 1,2,4,8
```

For each node count and object size, the test cleans the bucket, PUTs until at
least `nodes * WARP_PUT_MIN_FILES_PER_CLIENT` objects exist, sweeps GET thread
counts, and performs final DELETE cleanup. Each node count is a separate Slurm
job or SSH invocation.

Optional modes are `--multipart`, `--ranged`, and `--s3-express`. Ranged reads
run 30-second PUT stages until at least `nodes` objects exist in total, using
`WARP_RANGE_OBJ_SIZE` for object size and `WARP_OBJ_SIZES` for read range sizes.
This is a minimum, not an exact count; stages can create substantially more
objects, so budget storage accordingly.

Aggregate PUT and GET request-rate budgets are available through
`WARP_RPS_BUDGET_PUT` and `WARP_RPS_BUDGET_GET`. `WARP_PREFIXES` selects static
prefixes and requires [NVIDIA/warp-minio](https://github.com/NVIDIA/warp-minio).

## Reporting

`extract-warp.sh` generates terminal tables and PNG plots for throughput, TTFB
latency, and scaling efficiency. It supports size/thread filters,
`--per-client-plots`, `--to-json`, and `--from-json`. Repeat `--only-sizes` or
separate several sizes with `;`; commas are not split. Markdown output is not
implemented.

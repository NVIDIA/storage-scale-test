# Coding standards

Detailed coding standards for `storage-scale-test`. Referenced from
[AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md); read this when doing substantial Python or shell
work. `AGENTS.md` carries the lean, always-on summary; this file holds the
depth.

## Python

Python 3.12 or newer is required for repository Python tools and their pinned
dependencies.

### Cognitive complexity (<= 15 per function)
Most of these are enforced by tooling, but cognitive complexity is not, so apply
it deliberately when writing new code:
- Break complex logic into small helper functions BEFORE writing.
- Each helper should do ONE thing (parse, validate, transform, etc.).
- Nested conditionals and loops add complexity — extract them to helpers.
- Use early returns to reduce nesting depth.
- Data-driven approaches (dicts, lists of handlers) reduce branching.

```python
# BAD: nested conditionals
def process_data(data):
    for item in data:
        if item.type == "A":
            if item.valid:
                ...  # many lines
        elif item.type == "B":
            ...  # more nested logic

# GOOD: extract helpers, dispatch by table
def _process_type_a(item): ...
def _process_type_b(item): ...

def process_data(data):
    handlers = {"A": _process_type_a, "B": _process_type_b}
    for item in data:
        handler = handlers.get(item.type)
        if handler:
            handler(item)
```

### String constants
Never duplicate a literal string 3+ times — define a module-level
`UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` constant near the top of the file (e.g.
`GITHUB_PREFIX = "github.com/"`). When modifying code, check whether a new
literal duplicates an existing one.

### Linting / formatting
1. `black` 25.9.0+ (default line length 88), required after any Python change.
   If `black` or another required check tool is unavailable, install it into
   the repo's local environment and rerun the check.
2. `pylint` must score 10.00/10. If it does not, either fix the issue or add the
   check to the `.pylintrc` disable list only when the repository policy should
   exclude that check.
3. `.pylintrc` is canonical. It gates enabled fatal/error/warning checks plus
   exactly `C0200`, `C0411`, `R0801`, and `R1704`; all other C/R checks are
   disabled by category. For `R0801`, move reusable production helpers into
   `lib/` and repeated test infrastructure into a shared test helper.
4. Run combined: `black file1.py file2.py && pylint -j 1 file1.py file2.py`
   (`-j 1` avoids parallel pylint, which often fails in sandboxes).
5. Prefer the alternate quote character inside f-string expressions when it
   improves readability; Python 3.12 supports either form.
6. Run analysis scripts via their shell wrappers (e.g. `utils/extract-elbencho.sh`),
   not the `.py` directly, so the venv is set up.

## Shell

### Always run shellcheck (entire repo)
After modifying ANY `.sh` file:

```bash
shellcheck $(find <repo-root> -name '*.sh' -not -path '*/tmp/*')
```

Fix all errors and warnings. For intentional exceptions, add
`# shellcheck disable=SCXXXX` with an explanatory comment. This command is safe
to run in the sandbox without requesting permissions.

### Best practices
- **Quoting**: always quote variables (`"$var"`); the only exception is
  intentional word splitting.
- **Error handling**: `cd ... || exit` / `cd ... || return`; check exit codes
  directly (`if ! command; then`); separate declaration from command
  substitution to avoid masking return values:
  ```bash
  local result
  result=$(some_command)   # good
  # local result=$(some_command)  # bad: SC2155 masks the return value
  ```
- **Sourced files**: use `# shellcheck shell=bash` instead of a shebang;
  `# shellcheck disable=SC2154` for caller-set variables;
  `# shellcheck disable=SC1091` for external sourcing.
- **Arrays**: `"${array[@]}"` for separate words, `"${array[*]}"` for a single
  word (e.g. error messages); never use unquoted `$@` / `$*`.
- **Traps**: single quotes — `trap 'cleanup' EXIT`, not `trap "cleanup" EXIT`
  (SC2064).
- **String constants**: same 3-occurrence rule as Python — extract a
  `readonly NAME="value"` constant and reference `"$NAME"`.

### Common patterns
1. **Remote scriptlets** (executed over SSH): export all variables, add shebang
   `#!/usr/bin/env bash`.
2. **Sourced library files** (`_*_functions.sh`): apply the "Sourced files"
   rules above.
3. **SSH/Slurm wrappers**: handle `cd` failures with `|| exit` / `|| return`.

## Maintaining docs/CONTEXT.md

[docs/CONTEXT.md](CONTEXT.md) is the WHAT/WHY knowledge base: architecture,
design decisions, invariants, and error patterns. It describes the repository's
current state, not its history — it is explicitly not a changelog or an
implementation journal. Update it after significant work.

**When**: multi-step tasks (3+ edits across files); non-obvious component
relationships; tricky bug fixes / error patterns; architectural guidance or
design decisions; significant features/refactors/benchmarking; new tool/command
patterns.

**How**: add or revise entries under the appropriate section so the document
keeps describing how the repository behaves today. Correct or delete statements
that a change has made obsolete rather than appending a note that supersedes
them. Keep entries concise (1-4 sentences) and specific (file and function
names, concrete examples); flag uncertainties with "Note:" / "Verify:". Keep
filenames in backticks and snippets in code blocks.

# AGENTS.md

Canonical instructions for AI coding agents; `CLAUDE.md` imports this file.
Humans: start with [README.md](README.md). Depth lives in docs to read on demand:
- Coding standards (Python/shell detail, linting): [docs/CODING_STANDARDS.md](docs/CODING_STANDARDS.md)
- Architecture, design decisions, error patterns, recent work: [docs/CONTEXT.md](docs/CONTEXT.md) — read before non-trivial work; update it afterward.

## Delegation (mandatory)

You MUST run every independent task (searches, reviews, checks, per-file work)
as concurrent sub-agents, maximizing parallelism. Give each the most
cost-efficient model that can do it well.

## What this is

Shell and Python tooling that runs distributed storage benchmarks across a fleet
of client nodes and turns the raw output into readable tables and plots. It
orchestrates third-party benchmark binaries (elbencho for filesystem/network,
Warp for S3-compatible object storage) as **separate processes** — they are
**never bundled or vendored** into this repo; users download or build them.

## Architecture

- `storage-tests/{fs,object,network}/` — test entry points with `ssh/` and
  `sbatch/` substrate code; filesystem tests also have `kubectl/`.
- `lib/` — shared Bash libraries (`env_*.sh`, `_*_functions.sh`) + a few Python helpers.
- `utils/` — self-bootstrapping Python result tools (`extract-*.py`) and build helpers (`build_tarball.sh`, `build/`).
- `tests/` — `pytest` unit tests for the Python parsers/reporters.
- `docs/` — `DESIGN.md`, `REQUIREMENTS.md`, `ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAMS.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, `CODING_STANDARDS.md`.
- Config is environment-driven (`env.sh`); `EXECUTION_SUBSTRATE` explicitly
  selects Slurm, passwordless SSH, or kubectl for filesystem sweeps.

## Setup

```bash
cp env.sh.template env.sh        # then edit for your environment
python3 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt  # matplotlib, numpy, PyYAML, zstandard
./validate_env.sh                # iterate until it runs cleanly
```

See the README "Getting Started" section for the full quickstart and
[BENCHMARK_RECIPES_FILESYSTEM.md](BENCHMARK_RECIPES_FILESYSTEM.md) for tuned settings.

## Checks (run before committing)

CI lint and pytest must find nothing these checks missed. Commit or push only
after the full script exits 0; judge it by exit status and full output, never a
grep of the score. Report any failure you cannot fix.

```bash
./utils/run_ci_checks.sh
```

After changing `.github/`, parse every `.yml`/`.yaml` beneath it with a YAML
parser.

Install any missing check tool into the repo's local environment and rerun;
never skip required tooling.

The script reuses `.venv-ci` with the pinned tools. Pass `lint`, `compliance`,
`shellcheck`, `black`, `pylint`, or `pytest` to run one check. Set
`CI_CHECK_JOBS=1` in a constrained sandbox; in a network-restricted one, set
`CI_BOOTSTRAP=0` and use `CI_PYTHON`/`CI_SHELLCHECK`. Run tests and lint only
through this script or an environment populated from both requirements files;
ambient tooling, preloaded sandbox packages, and `.venv-ci` do not prove CI
readiness. When changing runtime imports or CI entry points, also reproduce the
workflow's dependency bootstrap and smoke-test its command in a clean
environment.

`black` must be 25.9.0+; `pylint` must report zero messages (its score rounds
to 10.00 despite a warning). Details: [docs/CODING_STANDARDS.md](docs/CODING_STANDARDS.md).

## Key conventions (non-obvious; don't restate linter-enforced rules)

- **Do not vendor third-party binaries or code** (elbencho is GPL-3.0, Warp is
  AGPL-3.0). They are invoked as separate processes; keep it that way.
- **License header**: every text file carries the NVIDIA Apache-2.0 header (the
  block at the top of this file) in its comment syntax; copy it verbatim.
  `LICENSE` is exempt; `README.md` carries the notice in its Copyright section
  at the bottom.
- **elbencho behavior**: do not rely on elbencho source older than **3.0.37**;
  prefer a local checkout at `tmp/elbencho-src` when present over web snippets.
- **Python**: keep each function's cognitive complexity <= 15 (not linter-enforced);
  avoid duplicating a literal string 3+ times (use a constant).
- **Kubernetes probe diagnosis**: `kubectl exec` returning `-9` does not prove
  OOM or broken Pod networking. Check OOM evidence, then run the socket operation
  from a Pod-resident script. If only exec-carried socket code is killed, keep
  network I/O in the Pod and use exec for bounded request/result transfer.

No external contributions currently. Maintainer PRs: stay focused, pass the
checks above, and update `README.md`/`docs/` when behavior or configuration
changes.

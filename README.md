# NVIDIA Storage Scale Test

Shell and Python tools for running distributed storage benchmarks and turning
their results into tables and plots.

- [Filesystem testing](docs/FILESYSTEM_TESTING.md): data IO and metadata with elbencho.
- [Object storage testing](docs/OBJECT_STORAGE_TESTING.md): S3-compatible storage with Warp.
- [Network testing](docs/NETWORK_TESTING.md): peer throughput and latency with elbencho (beta).

## Warning: these tests destroy data

Tests **create, overwrite, and delete files and objects**. Use dedicated test
directories and empty, disposable buckets. Root access is neither required nor
recommended.

## Getting started

The workflow is **configure → validate → run → report**. Run commands from the
repository root or an unpacked deployment directory.

1. Prepare a host that can reach your workers: a Slurm login host, a
   passwordless-SSH launcher, or a workstation authorized for your Kubernetes
   cluster. See [prerequisites and deployment](#prerequisites-and-deployment).
2. Create the configuration:

   ```bash
   cp env.sh.template env.sh
   ```

3. Edit `env.sh`: [select an execution substrate](#configure-the-execution-substrate),
   configure connection settings, and choose workload targets.
   `RESULTS_DIR` sets the parent directory for local results.
4. [Validate](#validate-and-correct-the-configuration), fix reported problems,
   and repeat until it passes:

   ```bash
   ./validate_env.sh
   ```

5. Follow the [filesystem](docs/FILESYSTEM_TESTING.md#first-io-sweep),
   [object](docs/OBJECT_STORAGE_TESTING.md#configure-the-target-and-run-a-sweep),
   or [network](docs/NETWORK_TESTING.md#configure-and-run) guide to run and report.

Each run creates its own directory below `RESULTS_DIR`. Use that complete
printed directory, not its parent, for reporting and lifecycle commands.
Filesystem launchers can also vary workload settings per run with
[`--env-override <file>`](docs/FILESYSTEM_TESTING.md#workload-override-files)
instead of edits to `env.sh`.
Kubernetes runs asynchronously: collect terminal results before reporting.

## Prerequisites and deployment

- Benchmarks and Slurm orchestration require Linux. macOS can launch SSH and
  kubectl filesystem sweeps with Homebrew's Bash (4.3+) first on `PATH`
  (`brew install bash coreutils`; kubectl also needs `gnu-tar flock`).
- Reporting requires Python 3.12+. The extraction wrappers set up their Python
  dependencies.
- SSH/Slurm workers need benchmark binaries under `utils/` for each client
  architecture; see the archive builder below. Kubernetes uses the configured
  workload image instead.

Use a prepared checkout or create a deployment archive:

```bash
./utils/build_tarball.sh
```

It downloads pinned elbencho binaries into `utils/` (keeping existing or
custom builds unless `--force-download` is given), includes Warp binaries if
present ([Warp preparation](docs/OBJECT_STORAGE_TESTING.md#prepare-the-tools)),
builds `s3test`, and writes `storage-scale-test.tar.gz` (without `docs/`;
read guides in the checkout or repository browser). Unpack it on your launcher
and configure its `env.sh`. A failed download only warns, so confirm the tools
for every client architecture. Neither the repository nor NVIDIA distributes
these binaries; see [NOTICE](NOTICE) for provenance and licenses (elbencho
GPL-3.0, Warp AGPL-3.0).

## Configure the execution substrate

Set `EXECUTION_SUBSTRATE` explicitly in `env.sh`; there is no default.
`SSH_HOST_LIST` configures SSH but does not select it.

| Substrate | Filesystem | Object storage | Network |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ssh` | Supported | Supported | Beta |
| `slurm` | Supported | Supported | Beta |
| `kubectl` | Supported | Not supported | Not supported |

### Passwordless SSH

```bash
export EXECUTION_SUBSTRATE=ssh
export SSH_HOST_LIST=/absolute/path/to/host_list
# export SSH_USER=ubuntu       # otherwise your user/SSH configuration applies
# export SSH_HOMEDIR_SHARED=1  # set only if workers share a home directory
```

The host list accepts comma- or whitespace-separated hosts across multiple
lines and ignores comment lines. Authentication must be non-interactive.
Filesystem paths must exist on every selected worker:

```bash
declare -A TEST_DIRS=(["/mnt/fs/scaletest"]=1)
```

### Slurm

```bash
export EXECUTION_SUBSTRATE=slurm
account="your-account"
partition="your-partition"
reservation=""                 # set if your site requires one
```

Configure site modules, `client_type`, and `client_arch` in `env.sh`.
Filesystem `TEST_DIRS` use worker-side paths as above. Set `run_time` for
the complete filesystem sweep or batch, including startup and cleanup.
See [advanced node selection and Slurm options](docs/FILESYSTEM_TESTING.md#advanced-node-selection-and-slurm-options).

### Kubernetes

Authorize `kubectl` for the intended context first:

```bash
export EXECUTION_SUBSTRATE=kubectl
export KUBECTL_NAMESPACE=storage-scale-test
export KUBECTL_PV=storage-scale-test-pv
export KUBECTL_PVC=storage-scale-test-pvc
export KUBECTL_NODE_SELECTOR='storage-scale-test/worker=true'
export KUBECTL_ELBENCHO_IMAGE=docker.io/breuner/elbencho:v3.2-1
export KUBECTL_IMAGE_PULL_POLICY=IfNotPresent
export KUBECTL_RUN_AS_USER=2000
export KUBECTL_RUN_AS_GROUP=2000
declare -A TEST_DIRS=(["scale-test"]=1)
```

The tool provisions no cluster, namespace, PV, or PVC; complete the
[Kubernetes prerequisites](docs/FILESYSTEM_TESTING.md#kubernetes-prerequisites)
before validating. For lifecycle commands, durable storage layout, and
troubleshooting, see the
[filesystem guide](docs/FILESYSTEM_TESTING.md#kubernetes-run-inspect-and-collect).

## Validate and correct the configuration

Run `./validate_env.sh` after configuration changes. It probes the selected
substrate and enabled workloads (nonempty `TEST_DIRS` for filesystem, a set
`OBJ_BUCKET` for object): writable paths, object access (a nonempty bucket
fails), and temporary Kubernetes validation resources. Read detailed errors and
diagnostic paths above the final summary. Disabled-test notes and the
[Kubernetes object inventory](docs/FILESYSTEM_TESTING.md#kubernetes-access-and-troubleshooting)
are informational, not failures.

Fix configuration errors in `env.sh`; take mount, admission, registry, or CNI
evidence to your cluster/storage administrator. Repeat until it prints
`All validation checks passed successfully`. Validation cannot prove every
workload or performance limit; start with a small run before scaling.

# Roadmap Items (last updated 2026-10-11)

## Completed

- Add kubectl as the filesystem Elbencho execution substrate. It uses an
  existing authorized cluster, namespace, and bound RWX PVCs; submits a
  durable asynchronous sweep, and supports status, cancel, collect, and
  collection-gated resume.
- Add `--env-override` workload files to the filesystem launchers.
- Add sweep across multiple storage targets
  ([#16](https://github.com/NVIDIA/storage-scale-test/issues/16)): on
  Kubernetes, claim-qualified `TEST_DIRS` roots (`[namespace/]claim:path`)
  make one aggregate target across several claims in one namespace, with
  weighted load as on SSH and Slurm; a repeatable `--target FILE` tests
  several filesystems as separate batch groups on every substrate; storage
  target names, a report mixing guard, and repeatable `--env-override`. A batch
  that spans several Kubernetes namespaces runs them in order through an
  in-cluster sequencer; one namespace needs none. See
  [Testing several filesystems](docs/FILESYSTEM_TESTING.md#testing-several-filesystems).
- Add prepared filesystem batches (`--batch`, `--append`, `--start`) that
  accumulate sweep executions and run them from one resumable batch.
- Add completion-based (finite dataset) filesystem sweeps
  (`--run-to-completion`).
- Make metadata (mdtest) sweeps resumable on SSH, Kubernetes, and Slurm.
- Shard filesystem integration CI by substrate.

## P0

- Integrate with AI Cloud Validation
(https://github.com/NVIDIA/ai-cloud-validation).
    - Exercise the implemented kubectl substrate in the validation suite.
    - Drive prepared batches (`--batch`/`--append`/`--start`) from the
      validation suite's orchestrator.
    - Watch out for (current) 10m AI Cloud Validation test timeout--figure
      out the appropriate enhancement for that test suite to allow storage
      tests that may take some time to complete.
- High-scale timing-workers to facilitate at-scale resilience testing.

## P1

- Many-uid high-scale metadata load driving (probe for LDAP integration
  scaling issues on NFS systems).
- Add storage fault-injection tests to AI Cloud Validation.

## P2

- Improve scalability of SSH execution mode.
- Expand unit and regression tests. Audit test coverage and improve it.
- Reduce the differences between filesystem and object testing execution
  & reporting.
- Block storage (without filesystems) if necessary
- Add support for GDS?
